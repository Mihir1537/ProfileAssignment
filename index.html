  <h1 style="color: MediumSeaGreen;">Personal Information</h1>
  <h3>Name: Mihir Anand</h3>
  <h3>Student Number: s3943963</h3>
  <h3>Student Email Address: s3943963@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
  <h3 style="color: MediumSeaGreen">Background Information:</h3>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma"> My nationality is Indian, and I speak multiple languages, such as English and Hindi. I graduated from Rowville Secondary College and I’m now currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My favourite hobby is playing basketball and I have played competitive basketball for about 6 years. During these years, I earned several awards, and my school basketball team was ranked the 4th best in Australia for my age group in 2019.</p>
  <h1 style="color: Tomato">Interests in IT</h1>
  <h3 style="color: Tomato">What is my interest in IT?</h3>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma">I am interested in information technology because there are a wide variety of areas that can be specialised in, which allows me to have a more open mind when choosing my career in the future. I am interested about learning how to use different software and programming languages as it is a significant skill in most IT jobs and fields, such as cyber security. I am further interested in learning about robotics and how they are programmed, designed, manufactured, and functioned to produce specific tasks. My interest in IT started in my senior year of high school, when my uncle talked to me about the different types of IT subjects and how it exposes you to a lot of job opportunities, since the IT industry is always in demand.</p>
  <h3 style="color: Tomato">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma">I chose to come to RMIT as it is highly recognised in Australia and provides me with the opportunity to enhance my knowledge and skills about my course. RMIT has numerous resources and connections, which allows me to gain placements and work experience in many well-known organisations in Melbourne. I also chose to come to RMIT as it is in the city, allowing me to expose myself to the city life, filled with a variety of food options and activities. Another reason why I found RMIT appealing to come to was because of the great feedback from previous students. I was informed that the teachers communicate well with students and provide a significant amount of assistance to ensure that students’ lives are made easier. For example, RMIT provides support services and networks, such as RMIT connect.</p>
  <h3 style="color: Tomato">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma">I expect to learn a vast number of aspects of IT in this course. I expect to develop an understanding of programming languages, including understanding the importance of using these tools in a working environment. I also expect to learn about networking, artificial intelligence, cloud, storage, privacy, and security. I further expect to gain the ability to work as a team as well as working individually on assignments and projects. In addition, I expect to further grow my ability to apply my knowledge to solve problems relating to IT.</p>
  <h1 style="color: SlateBlue">Ideal Job</h1>
  <img src="ideal job.png" width="550" height="400">
<p> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56241337?type=standout#sol=667524394e614556c516adec0d998574f72e59ae" target="_blank">seek.com.au</a>
</p>
<h3 style="color: SlateBlue">Description:</h3>
  <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Cyber security specialist is a role that involves detecting suspicious activities or policy violations. The primary responsibility of this role is to ensure that important networks and data is protected and safeguarded by setting up security programs. Cyber security specialists also design firewalls to prevent cyber-attacks against governments and other organisations. I find this position appealing to me as I’m interested in learning about security and practicing it in the real world. I think setting up security programs to prevent cyber-attacks is quite compelling and I can envision myself doing this as my job.</p>
  <h3 style="color: SlateBlue">Skills Required:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">This role requires an individual to have a variety of different types of skills. Requires problem solving skills, meaning being able to find creative ways to deal with complex information security challenges. Demands communication skills and being able to work as a team, as it is a role that requires working closely with individuals from other roles and departments. It is important to effectively communicate with others to prevent potential threats and discuss about possible solutions to any concerns. This role also calls for strong IT skills and knowledge, including hardware, software, and networks. Another key skill requirement is to have a thorough understanding on hacking and having the ability to “ethically hack”, as well as having an understanding on a how system can be breached. This role further demands computer forensic skills and customer service skills.</p>
<h3 style="color: SlateBlue">Qualifications and Experience Required:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">The qualifications and experience required to become a cyber security specialist, includes having a bachelor’s degree in associated information technology fields such as network design or database management, plus 3-5 years of relevant experience. Must have experience in installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting Windows and Linux operating systems. Experience in networking, firewalls and intrusion detection is essential. The role also requires having knowledge of security standards and frameworks, such as ASD 8. Another crucial requirement is to have experience in monitoring and vulnerability scanning. Experience in customer service is also much needed.</p>
<h3 style="color: SlateBlue">My skills, qualifications, and experience: </h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">I currently haven’t learnt or excelled in any of the skills listed above due to me being new to IT and having no work experience, however I’m optimistic that one day I will obtain such skills and qualifications for this position in the future. </p>
<h3 style="color: SlateBlue">My plan to achieve the skills, experience, and qualifications to become a cyber security specialist: </h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">In year one of my course at RMIT I will pick security-based subjects, such as information systems security and security testing. Then in year 2, I will have the opportunity to study security in computing and information technology, which will enhance my skills relating to security. By the end of my third year of university, I will have completed my bachelor’s degree in information technology, which puts me one step closer to my future goals and objectives. Afterwards I will seek to gain work experience that is related to security for about 3-5 years. My next step then will be to network with the right people and look for opportunities to grow in this industry.</p>

</p>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">The results from all the tests provided above indicate that I portray the characteristics of integrity, practical logic, dedication, and the ability to shift one’s perspective on a situation. Furthermore, the learning styles test demonstrates that I am a visual learner, meaning that my preferred method of learning is through understanding and remembering information through sight. It also shows that I am a tactical learner, meaning I like to participate in activities when understanding new concepts. For me I think these are good qualities to have in an individual. However, these results also suggest that I am a shy and introverted individual, which are not ideal characteristics to have. Having a reserved personality can have negative affect on my behaviour when put in a team, as I will not be able to effectively communicate with my other team members. This may lead to possible errors and mistakes that could ultimately disrupt the team’s work and responsibilities. To avoid this dilemma, it would be a better option to form a team that I am familiar with so I could be in a more comfortable environment. Otherwise, I could look to improve in being more confident in social interactions.</p>
<h1 style="color: DodgerBlue">Project Idea</h1>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Overview:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">My project idea is to develop a free downloadable smartphone app called Play and Date.  This will be an interactive platform where parents can help children build their social life within a safe and secure environment. Parents that are too busy working and don’t want to leave their children home alone can benefit from this app. Using this app will simplify the process of arranging children to play together and to create plans with friends and family, as it provides numerous useful features. Overall, the purpose of this project is to provide parents with the solution to avoid leaving their children home on their own.</p>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Motivation:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">“A recent U.S Census report shows 7 million of the nation’s 38 million children ages 5 to 14 are left home alone regularly.” Children who are not supervised tend to show high levels of anxiety, stress, and loneliness. They are also at a much larger risk to be involved in accidents and to be victimized by strangers. Using Play and Date is a quick and easy solution to this problem. This app provides safety and allows parents to go to work without constantly worrying about their children. This application is also useful as it provides an easier method to manage scheduling and allows parents to make better and safer arrangements for their children. </p>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Description:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">This application will allow users to experience social interaction with their loved ones in an exciting and entertaining way, as it includes many intriguing features. It will have a calendar which will display the days when the parents are available. Users will also be able to display important information, such as home address, phone numbers and an emergency contact list. This feature is provided for safety reasons, so in the event of an emergency, the parent responsible for taking care of the children will have access to these details. However, it is also understandable if some users feel uncomfortable putting private details online, so there will be security measurements put in place such as a secure password and the ability to choose who can see and access certain information, this will help prevent unauthorised access to sensitive information. The aim of this app is for children to be in a safe social environment; therefore, parents will have the ability to create tables and diagrams filled with important information that is necessary for their children, and the ability to add this crucial information to their accounts/pages. For example, parents have the option of creating a list of allergies to inform and alert the other users, which encourages safe social interaction and helps prevent dangerous situations. This feature can also be utilised to inform other parents about their child’s favourite activities, this could include their favourite books, movies, sports, board games, etc. GPS tracking will also include in this app, which allows users to know how far the other individual is and how long it is approximately going to take to reach their destination. The additional feature of the GPS system helps prevent accidents on the road by restricting texting while driving, and as a result prevents alarming situations. However, if the user feels that their privacy is being breached, the app is quite flexible, and they can either turn their location on or off.  This app will also allow users to access their camera and photos through the app. It will include a variety of fun filters, which users can utilise to design their own accounts filled with exciting photos. Play and Date will have a scrapbooking feature, where parents can store the photos of their children having fun with their friends. Although Play and Date will be a free downloadable app, there will still be as subscription fee that will require users to pay $5 dollars per month. However, new users will have the opportunity to subscribe for a free month trial. This will allow parents to take this app for a test run and decide if they would like to continue this fun and safe experience. On top of all that, Play and Date will provide customer service relating to any questions or concerns that customers might come across relating to the app. On this app, customer service will be taken very seriously as it is vital to build trust with the users.</p>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Tools and Technologies:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">The tool required for this application is Appy Pie. Appy Pie is an app development software that enables users to create mobile applications compatible with operating systems such as IOS and Android. Appy Pie is quite beneficial for this application as it simplifies the task of creating the smartphone application. It also provides the ability to write HTML and CSS, which can be used to build IOS, and Android based mobile applications. Appy Pie automatically provides flexibility, as it includes many features. Appy Pie is simple, helpful, and easily accessible, therefore I believe this software is the best tool to use to create my application.</p>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Skills Required:</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: Tahoma">User interface and user experience</li>
  <li style="font-family: Tahoma">Designing skills: Refers to how the app will look. It is ideal to have an app that is appealing to users</li>
  <li style="font-family: Tahoma">Communication skills:  It is important to have a clear communication with the users. Ability to clearly help and guide users that seek assistance</li>
  <li style="font-family: Tahoma">Security skills: It is important to have sensitive and private information of the users to be protected </li>
  <li style="font-family: Tahoma">The ability to use Appy Pie </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">The skills are fairly feasible, and the software isn’t too complicated. There isn’t a whole lot of programming involved and the product doesn’t require years of experience.</p>
<h3 style="color: DodgerBlue">Outcome:</h3>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma">By successfully implementing the project, parents will have the opportunity to help their children build their social lives within a safe and secure environment. Furthermore, parents will also be able to go to work without the constant fear and worry about their child being unsupervised at home. The use of this application would help reduce the number of children left unattended, and this would help result in less alarming situations. The importance of a healthy social life for children will be enhanced by this app, which will ultimately have a positive impact on society.</p>
